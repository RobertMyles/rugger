:new_zealand: :ireland: `r emo::ji("wales")` `r emo::ji("england")` :south_africa: :australia: `r emo::ji("scotland")` :fiji: ^[Black flags?! They're Github's fault. The flags represent the rankings as of the tp 8 at the end of 2018 -- New Zealand, Ireland, Wales, England, South Africa, Australia, Scotland and Fiji. You can see them in R with `emo::ji("wales")`, for example.]

rugger is a rrrrugby package :rugby_football:. Get stats on teams, players, rankings and calculate changes in the rankings for a certain match. 

## Installation

You can install rugger with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("RobertMyles/rugger")
```

## Usage

You can see the current world rankings with `get_rankings()`:

```{r}
library(rugger)
get_rankings()
```

Hmmm, what would happen if New Zealand played Ireland tomorrow, and Ireland won by 5 points?
```{r}
calculate_rank("New Zealand", "Ireland", score = c(15, 20))
```

Yay, we'd jump into first place (sorry, biased!).  

Let's have a look at the history between England and Scotland, the first two teams to play the game:
```{r}
get_team_records("England", "Scotland")
```

England winning almost 62% of the matches there. 

I wonder which player has scored most tries in rugby?

```{r}
library(dplyr)

get_team_records(type = "player") %>% 
  arrange(desc(points))
```
