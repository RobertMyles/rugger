# rugger  

:new_zealand: :ireland: :wales: :england: :south_africa: :australia: :scotland: :fiji:

(WIP) rugger is a rrrrugby package :rugby_football:. You can see the current world rankings with `get_rankings()` and calculate the impact on the rankings of a hypothetical match with `calculate_rank()`. Right now it gets some data from [World Rugby]() and does some little calculations, maybe in the future it'll have info from [ESPN](http://stats.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/stats/index.html) and [Rugby Data](http://www.rugbydata.com). Let's see. If you're interested, feel free to fork and submit a PR. 

## Installation

You can install rugger with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("RobertMyles/rugger")
```

## Data etc.
All of the data acessed by this package is obviously for informational/educational use. It belongs to World Rugby. The algorithm that calculates the rankings also belongs to World Rugby, you can read about it [here](https://www.world.rugby/rankings/explanation).
